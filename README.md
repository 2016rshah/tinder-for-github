#Tinder of Github!

Swipe right for projects you like. Swipe left if you don't. Simple, right?

#Wait why?

The idea is that there are lots of projects on github that you might want to star, but would never even find. And also you want to show your projects to people who might like it and get stars. So you go through other people's projects and swipe. Then, if you and someone else both swipe right on each other's projects, you both get a star. If one of you swipe left, no harm done. 

#Please note:

In case you haven't noticed, I'm still working on the project. But feel free to contribute if you want the project to get done faster!
